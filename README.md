# IntelTimer8254
Verilog model and unit tests of the Intel Programmable Interval Timer 8254. Built using Sigasi with an add-on simulator for testing.

The aim of the project is to recreate the funtionalities offered by the original product, reverse engineering them from the publicly avaible datasheet (still presented in the repository).
As of last edit, all physical components and programming have been replicated, except some counting modes.

A full purview of the project can be found in https://github.com/EdoardoCaproni/IntelTimer8254/blob/main/Relazione%20Progetto%20Architettura%20dei%20Calcolatori.pdf, albeit in Italian.
